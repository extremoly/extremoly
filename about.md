## About Me

I am an 1 year undergraduate student with a strong interest in technology and digital projects. I focus on practical skills and self-learning, especially in areas related to software development and online platforms. I enjoy working on projects that combine problem-solving, creativity, and real-world use.

My education includes coursework in mathematics, computer science basics, and English, which supports both technical thinking and communication. Alongside school, I study web development independently, working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Git. I practice building small websites, scripts, and tools to improve my understanding of how systems work.

In my free time, I take part in tech-related activities such as learning from online courses, experimenting with code, and creating content for digital platforms. These extracurricular efforts help me apply theory to practice and continuously develop skills that are directly relevant to my current and future projects.
